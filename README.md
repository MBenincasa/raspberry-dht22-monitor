# Raspberry-DHT22-Monitor
### Description
This Angular project is used to display the data that is recorded by the DHT22 sensor.<br>
Among my various repositories there is one called **raspberry-dht22**. In that repository it is shown how to historicize data using the Python programming language. There is also the script to expose an API to read the data on the Google Sheet
